## Task 3: Impact of the Support Parameter

**Number of frequent itemsets for some selected values of support:**

| Minimum Support | Number of Frequent Itemsets |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
|                 |                             |
|                 |                             |

**Which value of min-support leads to the discovery of about 150 itemsets?**\
???

???
- **Indicate a high-confidence rule X → Y where Y → X has lower confidence.**\

## Task 5: Impact of Confidence

**Number of rules for some selected values of minimum confidence:**

| Minimum Confidence | Number of Rules |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
|                    |                 |

## Task 6: Rule Interpretation

**Top-3 interesting rules, with their rank w.r.t. confidence and lift:**

| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|                 |             |             |
|                 |             |             |
