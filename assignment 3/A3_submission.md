# Assignment III Submission

## Task 1: k-Means

- **Corresponds (more or less) to the three expected species?** **YES/NO**  

**Number of records in each cluster:**
| Cluster | Records |
|---------|----------|
| 1       |          |
| 2       |          |
| 3       |          |

## Task 2: Preprocessing

**Is it better to rescale before or after detecting and filtering out the outliers?**  
**Corresponds (more or less) to the three expected species?** **YES/NO**  

**Number of records in each cluster:**
| Cluster | Records |
|---------|----------|
| 1       |          |
| 2       |          |
| 3       |          |

**Coordinates of the three centroids:**
| Cluster | PW | PL | SW | SL |
|---------|----|----|----|----|
| 1       |    |    |    |    |
| 2       |    |    |    |    |
| 3       |    |    |    |    |

## Task 3: Choice of K

- **Which K corresponds to the best clustering? (using the Davies-Bouldin index).**  

---

## Task 4: Hierarchical Clustering

- **Using SingleLink, how many records are included in each of the two top clusters?**  

**Cluster sizes:**
| Cluster | Records |
|---------|----------|
| 1       |          |
| 2       |          |

**Which approaches producing (more or less) correct clustering corresponding to the three species, if any?**
| Method       | Correct? |
|--------------|----------|
| SingleLink   |          |
| CompleteLink |          |
| AverageLink  |          |

## Task 5: DB-Scan

- **How many clusters does DB-SCAN find with eps=1, min_samples=5?**  
- **Can you give a value for epsilon leading to two clusters (plus noise)?**  

### K-Distances
- **Which K did you use?**  
- **According to the k-distances plot, what value(s) of epsilon would you consider as a parameter to DB-Scan and why?**
